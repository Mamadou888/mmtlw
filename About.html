    <H1 align="center"> All about Me </h1>
    <p align="center"> My name is Assita Diallo and I have created this blog to motivate others to live a healthy lifestyle. </p>
        <p>I was born and raised in New York City. </p>
        <p>I am currently a sophomore at the University at Albany with an intended major in psychology and minor in neuroscience.</p> 
        <p> My career goal is to become a physical therapist. </p>
        <p> My favorite color is white and red. I love reading books and writing (both poetry and short stories </p>
        <P> I have lost over 25 pounds and I am still in the process of losing more and toning up. </P>
        
    <H2> The Reason why I started to lose weight: </H2>
         <p> "Once upon a time I was walking through a jungle and I met one of the prettiest and most fittest girl named fitness.</p>
         <p> As soon as I spotted her I fell in love. Ever since that day I married her and as of today we are still together.</p>
         <p> We have made 4 years together and I am very happy about it.  </p>
         <p> ........Just joking.... But there is a bit of truth in this story I tell........ ! </p>
         <p>   </p>
         <p> This short anecdote is the reason why I decided to lose weight and follow a healthy lifestyle </p>
        <p> But there is more to the story and here it goes: </p>
            <p> All my life I have been fat and my weight to me really never mattered to me until summer of 2011 </p>
            <p>  Before then I never really considered  how fat and unhealthy I was. </p>
            <p> I did not care about losing weight because I thought it was stupid.</p> 
            <p> I always thought that I was too young to worry about being fat and having to lose weight. </p>
            <p> Since I was younger my family members would always call me fat and talk about how I needed  to lose weight or soon I was only going to burst. </p>
            <p> When these jokes were being made I really did not mind because I took it as a joke, (so it basically went through one air and out the other. </p>
            <p> At first I did not store such negative comments in my head because I knew how damaging it would be on a young mind like mine. </p>
            <p> But because these very close family members of mind said it all the damn time It started to grow into my head. </p>   
            <p> And every time a comment about how everything I was eating was going to kill me and that I needed to stop eating all together started to bother me more and more .</p>
            <p>All these negative comments that I tried so hard to disregard just kept on building up in my system and after awhile I really started to believe I was fat. </p>
            <p> So what I started to do was wear big clothes to hid my fatness, which in turn I hid who I truly was. </p>
            <p> I tried not to eat for a couple of hours but as a fat-ass *(Excuse me) I really loved food too goddam much. </p>
            <p> Since I can remember, food has always made me feel better and it was just soo comforting to give up. </p>
            <p> So I gave up on trying to starve and did not care about my weight</p>
            <p> So I sort of started binge eating. This comfort that I found in food became my shield from all the hurt I was going though. </p>
            <p> But binge wating, especially as a child is extremely dangerous and by doing that I became fatter and unhealthier. </p>
            <p> When I went to the doctor, they continuously told my mother how overweight I was and at the rate I was going I was soon going to end up with diabetes and heart problems. </p>
            <p> But since I was young the idea of losing weight never occurred to me. It was not until I started high-school that I figured I had to change my life.  </p>
            <p> A close friend of mine and I had planned on working out together but there would always be an excuse as to why we could not start as soon as possible. </p>
            <p> Soon enough though I got tired of waiting and went ahead and signed up for planet fitness which was pretty cheap and amazing. </p>
            <p> When I started working out at the gym It was very difficult because I did not know where to start. </p>
            <p> Not only did I not know what to do, but I had very low endurance when working out. </p>
